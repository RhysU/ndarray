ndarray
=======

Hacking on a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)-like
[ndarray](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.ndarray.html) for
[R6RS Scheme](http://www.r6rs.org/), mainly as an excuse to work with the
language.  After installing [Akku](https://akkuscm.org/) one can clone this
repository then begin coding thusly::

    cd ndarray
    akku install
    source .akku/bin/activate
